# Prediction-of-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder
This project utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using the AQ-10 dataset. The system analyzes behavioral and demographic data to provide early ASD predictions, improving diagnostic efficiency and supporting timely interventions. A comparative analysis of algorithms, including SVM, Naive Bayes, and Weighted KNN, was conducted, with SVM identified as the most effective for this task. The project also incorporates a user-friendly web interface for data input and prediction.
